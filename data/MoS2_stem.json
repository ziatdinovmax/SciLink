    "synthesis_details": "V-doped MoS2 films were synthesized on c-plane sapphire substrates using a custom-built MOCVD system. Mo(CO)6 (99.99% purity, Sigma-Aldrich) and V(C5H5)2 (99.99% purity, Sigma-Aldrich) powders are placed into stainless steel bubblers and serve as the Mo and V precursors, respectively. During synthesis, the pressure inside the bubblers are kept constant at 735 torr, and the temperature is set to 24°C for Mo(CO)6 and 50°C for V(C5H5)2 to maintain a constant precursor vapor pressure. Concentration of Mo and V precursor in the growth chamber can be tightly controlled by introducing precise flow of H2 carrier gas through the bubblers. A high-purity H2S gas lecture bottle (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) is used as the sulfur source. Growths are carried out at a growth temperature of 1000°C and a pressure of 50 torr, using a multistep growth process",
