    "synthesis_details": "Samples were prepared from natural graphite (Kojundo Chemical Laboratory) using the conventional Hummers method 58 and drop-cast onto freshly cleaved highly ordered pyrolytic graphite or Au(111) substrates. The Au(111) substrates were prepared via the thermal evaporation of Au onto mica. The GO sheets on Au(111) underwent hydrazine reduction through exposure to hydrazine monohydrate (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.) vapor. The resultant hydrazine-exposed GO sheets were then thermally reduced by heating on Au(111) at 800 °C for 8 h under UHV.",
    "microscopy_type": "Current-mapping AFM imaging  were performed under UHV (∼5e-8 Pa) at room temperature using a commercially available AFM system (VT beam-deflection AFM, Omicron). In the small bias regime where the tunneling current is linearly dependent on the bias, the tunneling current signal is proportional to the local density of states near the Fermi level.",
